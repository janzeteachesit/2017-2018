This project, while not a true Capstone, is an opportunity to focus on an area of interest and dig a little deeper, with more guidance than you may have had on previous Capstone projects.  
### Projects
__[Civil Focus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zgB2dqvyUa_nSuTz4OD6IrehghhuIIyUVGPEMvkro6k/edit)__: build a detailed, 1/10 scale model with a removable roof of the STEM Lab, as well as a 1/50 scale exterior model of the school

__[Chemical Focus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j7rhVEbWi68TvEC5Ac5SLFIz6SSTTTbfuvBtZc6pgx8/edit)__:  build a seawater desalination/purification system, exploring the pros and cons of low cost versus low impact versus high effectiveness.
