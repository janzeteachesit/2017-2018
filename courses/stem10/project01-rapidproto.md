### September 2017

Welcome back!

_The purpose of this first project is to review prototyping in STEM works.  By the end of this you should be re-familiarized with the basic stages of a project, as well as the tools we commonly use._

### The Project 
_You must design a paper airplane that flies as far as possible on a single throw.  The plane must be made of a single piece of  8.5” x 11” printer paper.  You can modify the paper in any way you want with cuts and folds, but you may not add anything to the paper (tape, weights, etc.)._

### Teams
You will be working in teams of three.
### Phase 1:  Define and Explore
#### [Assignment 1:  Research & Prototyping \(20%\)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13UQp2ABQ_K4p4uwtChVPKUxAE20tE6V0HcPgkltE8_c/edit#)
The goal of this assignment is to work together and engage in rapid prototyping to explore the problem.  Using a mix of actual testing and the internet searches, develop the best paper plane and throwing technique possible within a limited time frame.
### Phase 2:  Plan and Build
#### [Assignment 2:  Design \(20%\)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1239dwWXsi2ZXaqOTtD5ibXwQ0Q-5r0_kTxu2XEMuook/edit#)
The goal of this assignment is to learn how to make and submit a pdf document of your design to the Google Classroom.
### Phase 3:  Test and Analyze
#### [Assignment 3:  Distance Competition \(20%\)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Thge8C00qgWJRvmkUrwOSVwnTlspQlUI26xZ5qj9uBE/edit)
The goal of this assignment is to test and measure the quality of your final design.
### Phase 4:  Report and Reflect
#### [Assignment 4:  Video Production \(20%\)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gBNhH_Pm7dYMtUlt3YbC_aisRZKpI9BSqk8wbbnKx2w/edit)
The goal of this assignment is to learn how to present and submit your project review in a video format.
#### [Assignment 5:  Retrospective & Peer Evaluation \(20%\)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lASj-bmHtnKtfOvjKdIVMRQSATklZHWAMPsWbyDPyA0/edit)
The goal of this assignment is to reflect on what you’ve learned about the project cycle and effective group work.
